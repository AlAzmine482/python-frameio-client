:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Pull Request Process

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to our repos or how we handle your PRs.

1. Ensure any environment variables or build dependencies are removed before posting PRs.
2. In the PR summary, note the features you're adding or changes you're making to existing interfaces.
3. Increase the version numbers ([example](https://github.com/Frameio/python-frameio-client/commit/3b6595aae9f8a0df984c937ca9938131afbb82c0)).  The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. If your PR includes more than a handful of commits, please squash the commits down to a single commit.
5. Pull Requests are typically merged once they receive approval from two Frame.io developers.  If you haven't gotten approval, feel free to ping us or send a reminder.
